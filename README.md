# DO - Music news website

"Do" is a music news website with a homepage for highlighted articles, five category pages (Cover story, News, Interviews, Live, Reviews), and a few others.
There are six articles on a homepage, the most popular one (the article which users voted the most), and five latest articles from all categories.
Each category page has four the most recent articles, along with their images, titles (truncated if needed), author's name, preview of text, the number of votes, and a Read more link.
If logged in, the user can vote for articles from this and few other pages. Visitors can vore only once for each article, but it is not forbidden to support their own creations.
Authors can edit and delete their articles, but not other people's.
